            <h2>Who Are We?</h2>
            <p> The Cat Adoption a local adoption center founded in 2010. We are made possible through our lovely volunteers, charity events, and the generous donations that we receive.
            <p>The Cat Adoption was founded to help as many cats as possible find their forever home.
            <p>Every year, according to the ASPCA, 1.4 million cats are euthanized. We want to make a difference in those numbers, no matter the size. Every cat is important to us.
                We appreciate each and every one of our volunteers.
            <p>If you are looking to volunteer today, please contact us via our About section.
            <h2>Our Goal</h2>
            <p>Our main goal is to help every furry cat friend find their perfect fit home. If you are interested in adopting a furry friend, please visit us in person.
